          <p>The smart design of the New Nordic by SAS cube saves up to 51 tons of plastic per year. The lightweight packaging lessens onboard mass balancing the carbon impact; a contributor to sustainable travel. The food concept by New Nordic transforms the meal experience on board, focusing on sustainability with locally produced and seasonal ingredients.</p>

          <p>We’ve taken the wordmark as a starting point: applying typographic details that can be combined in many surprising ways, like food ingredients. We have translated this into our design, using portions of the proud SAS logo. By slicing these elements, we have created a cohesive package line. The material used is natural craft paper, with embossed stamps to signify dishes and graphic shapes to distinguish menu items.</p>
